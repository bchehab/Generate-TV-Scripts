    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence Length: 15, since the average sentence length is ~5.5. 15 means the rnn can consider approximately 3 average sentences. I did two tests as shown above, one with 15 seq. length, and the other with 30 and the difference was negligible. I also tried with 10 during earlier tests, but other criteria prevented the model from properly learning, so I canno't judge whether 10 was too low, and how much of a factor is the sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Size: 512. this for me was the most important parameter. I spent hours and hours trying to get the max size out of the gpu. I tried almost all the possible criteria with a huge batch size. My analysis was that I could use a huge batch size, in order to quickly test out various configurations of the other hyper-parameters and find out whether they're working or not. I tried batch sizes of 1024, 2048, and 4096. We took during the course that a higher batch size saves computational time, and this is what i also read online. but i kept reading until i found references stating otherwise. My conclusion is that like all other hyperparameters, you need to get the best balance. A higher batch size saves computational time, and a lower batch size generates some noise which helps avoid getting stuck in local minima, and reaching better solutions. Eventually, I went with 512 which allowed me to reach an error below 3.5, in a relatively short time. I wasn't able to get below an error of 3.9 with a higher batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epochs: 10, since as early as the first epoch, i saw the error reduced to 4.x. So I figured that 10 would be enough to get to 3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Rate: 0.001. I tried 0.1 and 0.01, but I always got stock and the error started fluctuating. Those were tested with a very high batch size, so I cannot tell exactly if they would have worked otherwise. But I finally decided on 0.001 and it converged well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Dimension: 128. I went as high as 500. The rnn wouldnt converge. In the course, it is mentioned that google used 300 when they trained their model, so this model should be much simpler to train and i decided to go with a much lower value. I used a multiple of 32 since I read that some libraries/hardware won't make use of the performance available, if the data isnt a multiple of 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden Dimension: 256. Same as embedding dimension. I went all the way up till 500. My final tests showed that i can get a good result with lower values. I read a recommendation of making the size between the input and output sizes, and greater than the embedding dimension.\n",
